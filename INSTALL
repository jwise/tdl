Although tdl does not use autoconf, it does have a hand-rolled configure script.

To build the program do

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You can see what options ./configure can take with

    ./configure --help

For example, you might want to use --prefix to install the software in a
non-standard location.

To get started,

    tdl create
    tdl add "Some task I have to do"
    tdl list

It's suggested that you try

    man tdl

as well.
